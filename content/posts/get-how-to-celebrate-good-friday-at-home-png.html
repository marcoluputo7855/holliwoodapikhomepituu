    <h3>Recently russian people have begun to celebrate religious holidays again.</h3>
    <p>On the last friday before easter (good friday), no food or drink should be consumed until the evening. Russians rarely stay at home on easter; Other names used to refer to the good friday celebration include black friday, great friday, and holy friday. And they&#039;ve got a very good reason to celebrate this holiday because when the english pilgrims first came to the new world they had a very hard winter and it was questionable if most of them would survive.</p>
